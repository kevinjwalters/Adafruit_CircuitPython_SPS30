"""
Test program for Sensirion SPS30 device putting it through its paces using i2c.

SPS30 running 2.2 firmware appears to take around one second to change into the
requested mode for data type. Any read in that time will be in the previous format
causing bad data or CRC errors!

Reminder: SPS30 interface select pin needs to be connected to ground for i2c mode.
